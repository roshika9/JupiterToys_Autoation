1.What other possible scenario’s would you suggest for testing the Jupiter Toys application? 

1.	User who is having valid user credentials can logs in to the system successfully
2.	Validate logging page fields
3.	Verify checkout from cart
4.	Verify remove items from cart 
5.	Verify clear Cart

2. Jupiter Toys is expected to grow and expand its offering into books, tech, and modern art. We are expecting the of tests will grow to a very large number. 
1. What approaches could you used to reduce overall execution time? 
Parallel test execution
Schedule test cases to run at off peak time
Reduce the code complexity for fast execution
User headless execution
Do not use unnecessary wait times in the code
Test segregation	
Introduce Continues Integration tools

2. How will your framework cater for this? 

Use a CI tool like Jenkins
I use cypress so nor using arbitrary timeouts; Cypress has automatic retry mechanism
 Avoiding using xpaths; it is slower than other attributes
Run testcases in headless mode
Use parallel execution
Schedule to run test cases in off peak time 

3. Describe when to use a BDD approach to automation and when NOT to use BDD 

When to use BDD
	When need to separate test scripts from the test code
When need to onboard easily to automate the code
When need to take place easier reviews
When the project needs to have a good project structure 
When needs to avoid code duplication and practice high code reusability

When not to use BDD
	When teams are not much focusing on maintenance
	When there are lot of feature files to run parallel – difficult to run lot of feature files
	BDD automation too create extra dependencies, when we need to use minimal dependencies, BDD should not be used.
